# TBoIR
**Work in progress: I'm moving each subfolder to its own branch, do not rely on URLs from this branch.**

Resources of *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth*, for each game version.

Each branch contains the resource folders of the game. Branch names match game version names, and may include a `-hotfix<N>` suffix when a version was re-released with the same version number.

The `latest` branch contains resources from the latest game version: 1.9.7.5.J138.

### Notes
- Executables, compressed files, and tools are not included. The intent behind this repository is to simplify wiki maintenance, not for hacking the game.
- Some files are missing, mostly for the *Rebirth* and *Afterbirth* versions, because I don't know how they were named. The full file name list (for all versions) used to extract these files can be found in [`filelist.txt`](filelist.txt). Feel free open an issue/pr if you have any file name to add, all branches will be updated automatically.
- *Repentance+* files include a `resources-dlc3` folder, but it seems unused.
